# --- Step 1: DEFINE the function ---
# This part is like writing the recipe. The code inside doesn't run yet.

def greet_user():
    print("Hello, Christabel!")
    print("Welcome to your first function")
    
# --- Step 2: CALL the function ---
# Now that Python knows the recipe, we can "call" it to run the code.

print("The program starts here.")

# Python Learning Journey üêç

Welcome to my personal repository for learning Python! This project documents real progress from the core basics to intermediate-level concepts, including all my scripts, notes, and exercises.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Each major topic is organized into its own numbered folder (e.g., `01_python_basics`). Inside each folder, you will find:

* `/scripts`: Contains all the `.py` Python script files related to the topic.
* `notes.md`: A markdown file with my personal notes, key concepts, and code snippets.
* `/exercises`: Contains solutions to any practice problems for the topic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run a Python Script

To run a script, navigate to its directory in the terminal and use the `python` command:

```bash
python script_name.py
```
